## Ch6 Workflow: scripts
From [Chapter 6](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html)  
6.1 Running codes:  
You can create a new script in RStudio: **File --> New File --> R Script**  
Useful shorcuts:  
**`Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`** for running current line of codes. After running it, it will automatically move your cursor to the next code chunks.  
**`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S`** for execute the complete script.

RStudio working area  
```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-editor.png")
```  
  
#### RStudio diagnostic  
Hover over the cross to see what the problem is:  

```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-diagnostic-tip.png")
```  
  
#### RStudio will also let you know about potential problems:  

```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-diagnostic-warn.png")
```


## Ch7 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
From [Chapter 7](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html)  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a state of mind to develop an understanding of your data, and it is an interactive cycle:  
1.Generate questions about your data  
2.Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modeling your data.  
3.Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.  

#### Exercise

First have a look at the `diamonds` dataset:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# try to print first 5 rows
# try to see the summary statistcs of each column
diamonds
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

```{r histo-price, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# Visualize the distribution of price below 2500 using histogram
# hint: filter(), geom_histogram()
ggplot(data = filter(diamonds, price > 3000)) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=price))
```

```{r histo-price-hint}
ggplot(data = filter(diamonds, price < 2500)) +
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x=price),
    bins = 30, 
    center = 0
  )
```

#### EDA frist step: Generate a question  
Why there are no diamonds with a price of around $1500?  
These kind of questions can be raised during EDA. Chapter 7 introduces ways to investigate data, including **variation**, **missing values**, **covariation**, **pattern & models**.  
  
Here we will go through the exercise in **variation** (modified):  
```{r diamond-xyz, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# try to investiage the distribution of x,y and z in diamonds
ggplot(data = diamonds)
  # add your codes here, hint: geom_histogram
```

```{r diamond-xyz-hint}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(
    mapping = aes(x = x),
    bindwidth = 0.01
  )
```

Show the distribution of x, y, z using **geom_boxplot()** :  

```{r diamond-xyz-boxplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# merge x, y, z to the same column
diamonds.m <- melt(
  data = diamonds, 
  measure.vars = c("x","y", "z"),
  variable.name = "dimension"
  )

# please modified the codes and visualize the dimension: geom_boxplot()
ggplot(data = diamonds.m)
```

```{r diamond-xyz-boxplot-hint}
diamonds.m <- melt(
  data = diamonds, 
  measure.vars = c("x","y", "z"),
  variable.name = "dimension"
  )

ggplot(data = filter(diamonds.m, value < 30)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(x = dimension, y = value, color = dimension)
  )
```

## Ch8 Workflow: projects  
From [Chapter 8](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)  
### Suggestion on .RData and workspace:  
Do not preserve your workspace between sessions  
```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-workspace.png")
```  
Userful shorcuts:  
`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F10` to restart RStudio  
`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S` to rerun the current script  

You can find your current working path under console. You can also access using `getwd()` to print current working path and `setwd()` to set your current working path typing in console.  
  
### Paths and Directories are important when you are specifying where the files is. There are two suggestions:  
1. Do not use absolute paths since no one else will have exactly the same directory configuration as you.  
2. Use Mac/Linux slashes(`/`) to separate the components of the path. For example:  
```{r, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-wd.png")
```  
  
### RStudio projects  
In this section, I want you to try create a new project in RStudio, click **File --> New Project**:  
```{r, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-project-1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-project-2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-project-3.png")
```  
  
Now you should see a **.Rproj** file in your directory:  
```{r, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RPROJECT_2000.png")
```  
  
You can add today's scripts, plots, data in the current directory. Next time when you are going to reproduce your previous work. Have a try and have fun with it!

## Ch17: Program Introduction
You want your codes to be:  
1. Easy to write  
2. Easy to read  
3. Collaborate with other people and future-you  
The program chapter includes **Pipes**, **Functions**, **Vectors**, and **Iteration**.  
Additional learning materials:  
1. [Hands on Programming with R](https://amzn.com/1449359019)  
2. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)  

## Ch18: Pipes 
![pipe](https://codethislab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/5fb07b56984761.59c3e36095756.jpg)  
Thinking of your code as to get this man a beer by moving beer from start to the end. Pipes `%>%` is the tool in R to put pieces of codes together and it is from **magrittr** package which will be load automatically when you load tidyverse.  
  
```{r pipe-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# Try using pipe to combine step1 and step2

# create a simple dataframe with gene and expression
gene <- data.frame(
    name=c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC", "geneD", "geneE"),
    exp=sample(seq(1,10000), 5 )
)

# run without using pipes: step1 --> step2 --> step3
# step1
gene_ensg <- mutate(gene,  gene_ensg = str_c("ensg_", name))

# step2
gene_ensg_log2 <- mutate(gene_ensg, exp_log2 = log2(exp)) 

# step3
p <- ggplot(data = gene_ensg_log2, aes(x = gene_ensg, y = exp_log2)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="#f68060", alpha=.6, width=.4)
p
```

```{r pipe-example-hint}
gene %>% 
    mutate(name_ensg = str_c("ensg_", name)) %>%
    mutate(exp_log2 = log2(exp)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = name_ensg, y=exp_log2)) +
      geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="#f68060", alpha=.6, width=.4)
```

We can see pipe as an **intermediate output**. Suggested ways to use pipe:  
1. You only want the final output.  
2. You want to overwrite your data after some data analysis procedures, and do not want to save a lot of intermediate variables.  
  
There are times **not suggested** using pipes:  
1. You have function that will create new variable, e.g. assign(x, 10)  
2. You have function which does lazy evaluation.  
3. You have too many steps. It is hard to debug since you do not create intermediate variables.  
4. You have multiple inputs or outputs. Pipes is a linear way to connect steps.  
  
    
There are alternative pipes:  
**tee**, **replace**, **exposition**:  
```{r tee-operator, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# convert pipe to tee pipe to return matrix
rnorm(30) %>%
    matrix(ncol = 2) %>%
    plot()
```

```{r tee-operator-hint}
# convert pipe to tee pipe to return matrix
rnorm(30) %>%
    matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
    plot()
```
```{r replace-operator, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# use replace operator to reassign to your variable
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
    transform(cyl=cyl*2)
```

```{r replace-operator-hint}
mtcars %<>% transform(cyl=cyl*2)
```
```{r exposition-operator, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# use exposition operator to feed data column
cor(mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r exposition-operator-hint}
mtcars %$% cor(disp, mpg)
```

## Ch19: Functions 
The time you can consider writing your own function: when your doing a lot of repeating jobs (copy & paste), your code chunks grows bigger and bigger, and you want other people to use your function.  
**DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself**  
R function components:  
<img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-programming-with/9781449359089/images/hopr_0106.png" alt="drawing" width="800px"/>  
Ref: Hands on Programming with R  
1. The name: the name of a function is usually a **verb**. It is suggested to use **snake_case** or **camelCase**.  
2. The body: contain your executable codes.  
3. & 4. The argument and default value:  
- **x, y, z**: vectors.  
- **w**: a vector of weights.  
- **df**: a data frame.  
- **i, j**: numeric indices (typically rows and columns).  
- **n**: length, or number of rows.  
- **p**: number of columns.  
5. The last line of code: r function will return the output of the last line of your code and save it to your variable.  
```{r function-example, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
add_integer <- function(x,y){
    if(x%%1==0 && y%%1==0){
        x+n
    } else {
        round(x) + round(y)
    }
}

```  
```{r function-example-hint}
add_integer <- function(x,y){
    if(x%%1==0 && y%%1==0){
        x+n
    } else {
        round(x) + round(y)
    }
}

add_integer(3, 5.6)

```
Use `switch` to avoid nested function such as too many conditional statements.  
![ident hadoukan](https://external-preview.redd.it/6TTm4tS5pMCiq2KlgviubpGKt1QzvetOi2Z6Z3lB1Nc.jpg?auto=webp&s=c1df961d84c8d76048a93c1d261e425d3737d779)
```{r r-switch, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
math_operate <- function(x, y , op = "plus") {
    if (y != 0) {
        if (op == "plus") {
            x + y
        } else if (op == "minus") {
            x - y
        } else if (op == "times") {
            x * y
        } else if (op == "divide") {
            x / y
        } else {
            stop("Unknown op.")
        }
    } else {
        "Cannot divided by Zero"
    }
}
math_operate(3,5)
```
```{r r-switch-hint}
math_operate <- function(x, y , op = "plus") {
    if (y != 0) {
        switch(op,
              plus = x + y,
              minus = x - y,
              times = x * y,
              divide = x / y,
              stop("Unknown op.")
        )
    } else {
        "Cannot divided Zero"
    }
}
math_operate(3,5)

```

#### Use `stopifnot()` to check each argument is **TRUE** in your function
```{r r-stopifnot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
df1 <- tibble(
    studentID = seq(1:10),
    phone = r_phone_numbers(10, use_hyphens=TRUE)
)

df2 <- tibble(
    studentID = seq(1:6),
    name = randomNames(6)
)

df3 <- tibble(
    studentID = seq(1:10),
    name = randomNames(10)
)

combined_df <- function(df_x, df_y) {
    # add stopifnot() to check if all conditions are meet
    # (1) studentID should be matched, and row numbers should be the same
    df <- inner_join(df_x, df_y, by="studentID")
    df
}

combined_df(df1, df2)

```
```{r r-stopifnot-hint}
combined_df <- function(df_x, df_y) {
    stopifnot(all(df_x[,1] %in% df_y[,1]), nrow(df_x)==nrow(df_y))
    df <- inner_join(df_x, df_y, by="studentID")
    return(df)
}

combined_df(df1, df2)
combined_df(df1, df3)
```

If user want to import arbitrary number of arguments, we want the length of input to be flexible: dot, dot, dot `...`
```{r r-dotdotdot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
class_of_vars <- function(x, y) {
    list_var <- list(x, y)
    str(list_var)
}

class_of_vars(x = 1, y = "Tom")
```
```{r r-dotdotdot-hint}
class_of_vars <- function(...) {
    list_var <- list(...)
    str(list_var)
}

class_of_vars(a = 1, b = "Tom", c = TRUE, d = 4.456)
```

The last part is trying to write a function and use it with pipe `%>%`
```{r r-function-pipe, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
show_missings <- function(df) {
    n <- sum(is.na(df))
    cat("Missing values: ", n, "\n", sep="")
    invisible(df)
}

mtcars %>%
    show_missings() %>%
    mutate(mpg = ifelse(mpg < 20, NA, mpg)) %>%
    show_missings()

```

So you have quickly go through ch17-19. Horray!  
Next stage:  
```{r, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sugar.png")
```  
  
(just kidding XD)
